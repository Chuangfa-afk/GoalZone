## I. Business Understanding

The primary focus of this analysis is to enhance the booking system of GoalZone fitness classes, which often face issues of overbooking and low attendance. Through predictive data mining, we aim to optimize class schedules and maximize resource utilization.

<a name="data-understanding"></a>
## II. Data Understanding

The dataset from Kaggle includes detailed member information and class registration data. Variables like booking ID, membership duration, and attendance provide insights into customer behavior.

<a name="data-preparation"></a>
## III. Data Preparation

Data cleaning and transformation techniques were applied to address issues like missing values and inconsistent data formats, ensuring accuracy for analysis.

<a name="modeling"></a>
## IV. Modeling

We employed various data mining algorithms including NULL models, Logistic Regression, CART, and Random Forest to predict class attendance.

<a name="evaluation"></a>
## V. Evaluation

Models were evaluated using split testing and k-fold cross-validation to ensure accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

<a name="deployment"></a>
## VI. Deployment

The final model will enable GoalZone to predict class attendance, allowing for better resource allocation and enhanced customer experience.

<a name="ethical-considerations"></a>
## Ethical Considerations

We addressed potential data privacy concerns and emphasized the importance of ethical data handling and integrity in our methodology.

<a name="risk-mitigation"></a>
## Risk Mitigation

Strategies for mitigating risks associated with overbooking and data collection were outlined to ensure the successful implementation of our findings.
